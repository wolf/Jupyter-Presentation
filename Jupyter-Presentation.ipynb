In my day-job, I write software that helps teach kids to read.  In my spare time I use my favorite tools like Python, Vim, Xonsh, tmux, Jupyter, sqlite, and lots of other things I really like.  I don't use Jupyter Notebooks much (a little) in my professional career, but they're fun to play with.  I don't know a lot, but I can show you a few interesting things to get you excited about them."

In the normal case, use the \"Pair with Markdown\" (for example) command, and then when you make a change in the Markdown version of the notebook, it's quickly reflected in the `ipynb` version and vice versa.  This is the main reason it's better than `nbconvert`, below.\n",

Those are the prime reasons for me, anyway.  And when I say nifty, I mean _really_ nifty.  It did take me a lot of futzing around to get jupytext to do its automatic conversion thing.  I think mostly I just should have been more patient."
